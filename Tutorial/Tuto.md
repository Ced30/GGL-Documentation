# **Tutorial: setting up your first button using events**

Lets see how to make something simple using a toggle to group / ungroup a couple of other GUI elements.

- **1 - Create the room**:

For the sake of the example, We will create a room with a width of 1280, a height of 720, same for the viewport and window size, just like this:

- **2 - Create the toggle**:

The we grab a parent_GGL_toggle in the asset manager, drag it into the room, and by clickng on the "variables" tab, we can edit the label to begin with
