# Class parent_GGL_button_palette

This GUI element is used as a palette of buttons, all sharing the same "Activate method"
		( do a switch(label) to tell wich button clicked).
		
Quick setup: set the dimensions you want by stretching the instance in the 
					 room, pass an array of strings to the "parameters" variable,
					 then, pass a script to be exectuted by the buttons to the "Script_Activate"
					 variable.
					 
The buttons will be placed automatically to fit the dimensions, they will share
					 the same activate script, the same panel sprite and the same sounds as the container.
					 The container itself is not visible and not interactable.
