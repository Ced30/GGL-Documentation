## Class parent_GGL_menu

A GUI element desined to build in-game menus, it can contain sub_groups of GGL_sub elements.
You can navigate through the groups by switch them on / off (with a pop-in / pop-out effect).
The label should stay empty, so you can draw the group's labels instead, and this instance doesn't require a sprite,
as we don't draw it directly.
