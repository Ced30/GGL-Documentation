# Room Setup

The first layers of you room **must be the same** as in the picture below, 
- the first one is a layer reserved to run VFX like vignette, etc (see it in action in the demo rooms),
- the second one **must contain** an instance of **obj_GGL_controller** (mandatory), and finally,
- the third one, will contain all of the rest of you GGL instances.

**obj_GGL_controller** must be **the first GGL object of your instance creation order**, don't put any GUI elements before.
