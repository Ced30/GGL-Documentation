# Room Setup

The first layers of you room **must be the same** as in the picture below, 

![Room_setup](https://github.com/Ced30/GML-GUI-Library-GGL-Documentation/blob/main/Images/Room_setup.png)

- the first one is a layer reserved to run VFX like vignette, etc (see it in action in the demo rooms),
- the second one **must contain** an instance of **obj_GGL_controller** (mandatory), and all of the rest of you GGL instances.

**obj_GGL_controller** must be **the first GGL object of your instance creation order**, don't put any GUI elements before.
